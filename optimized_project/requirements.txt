# Core Streamlit for Frontend
streamlit>=1.28.0

# Core LLM and AI Libraries (Langchain stack)
langchain>=0.1.0 # Keeping version specifiers as in original
langgraph>=0.1.0
langfuse>=2.0.0 # For observability, assuming it's kept
langchain-google-genai>=1.0.0

# Potentially other LLM SDKs if the system is designed to be flexible.
# If only Google Gemini is used, these can be removed.
openai>=1.0.0
anthropic>=0.15.0
tiktoken>=0.5.0 # Often a dependency for OpenAI

# Vector Store and Embeddings
# chromadb is used by the original VectorStoreManager, langchain_chroma is its Langchain integration
langchain_chroma>=0.1.0 # Assuming this is the intended Chroma package for Langchain
chromadb>=0.4.0
# faiss-cpu was in original, but ChromaDB is the one implemented in VectorStoreManager.
# If FAISS is not directly used, it can be removed. Assuming Chroma is primary.
# sentence-transformers for embeddings, GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings is used now.
# If other embedding models were planned, keep sentence-transformers. For now, let's assume it might be used.
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0


# Data Processing & Pydantic
# pandas>=2.0.0 # Keep if any underlying Langchain/tool uses it.
# numpy>=1.24.0 # Keep if any underlying Langchain/tool uses it.
python-dotenv>=1.0.0 # For .env file loading
pydantic>=2.0.0 # Used by HRAgent models and Langchain

# Configuration
pyyaml>=6.0 # For YAML config files

# Audio processing for VoiceService (dependencies of speech_recognition and gTTS)
# speech_recognition library itself
speechrecognition>=3.8.1
# gTTS for fallback TTS
gTTS>=2.3.0
# For audio playback in Streamlit (if needed by VoiceService directly, or by app layer)
# pygame was in front/vocale.py (unused file). If not used by new VoiceService, remove.
# For audio_recorder_streamlit (used in call_ui.py)
audio-recorder-streamlit>=0.0.13
# requests for Google Cloud REST APIs in VoiceService
requests>=2.20.0

# Other direct dependencies from original files (e.g., hashlib is standard)
# Ensure all necessary Langchain sub-packages are covered by the main langchain install
# e.g., langchain-community, langchain-core if they were separate. The single langchain>=0.1.0 should handle most.

# Notes:
# - Removed: fastapi, uvicorn, jupyter, ipykernel, black, flake8, pre-commit, pytest*, loguru.
# - Review if 'openai', 'anthropic', 'tiktoken', 'sentence-transformers', 'pandas', 'numpy', 'faiss-cpu'
#   are strictly necessary if only Google Gemini and ChromaDB are used in the final minimal setup.
#   For now, retaining them cautiously.
# - `faiss-cpu` was removed as `VectorStoreManager` uses `Chroma`. If FAISS is a direct alternative, add it back.
# - `pygame` was removed as it was only in `vocale.py`.
# - `audio-recorder-streamlit` is added as it's used in `call_ui.py`.
# - `requests` is added for `VoiceService`'s REST API calls.
