# Makes 'app' a package, containing all Streamlit frontend UI components
# for the optimized_project.

# You can choose to expose certain main UI functions here if desired,
# but typically main_app.py serves as the primary entry point.

# Example:
# from .main_app import run_app
# __all__ = ["run_app"]
