Due to insufficient information in the initial ticket, it was closed and this follow-up is to request further details.\n\nThe original request (as detailed in the call summary with Tristan) was to retrain and evaluate the current recommendation model using a newly annotated dataset of customer interactions to improve performance. [Source: Call Conversation Summary]  However, insufficient information was provided to proceed.\n\nTo help us process your request efficiently, please submit a new ticket with the following information:\n\n\n* **Detailed description of the new dataset:**  Provide specifics about the data's content, size, annotation methodology, and any potential issues or considerations.\n* **Objectives for model retraining:** Clearly state the desired improvements in the model's performance.  What metrics will be used to evaluate success?\n* **Current model details:**  Briefly describe the existing recommendation model's architecture and current performance metrics. This will help us understand the context for retraining.\n\nOnce we receive this supplementary information, we can proceed with assigning the task and begin the retraining process.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.  We look forward to receiving your updated ticket.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Support Team",
