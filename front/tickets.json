I understand you're looking for guidance on redesigning a Figma login form to reduce user errors, based on recent usability testing.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided documents do not contain any information relevant to Figma login form design, usability testing, or error reduction strategies.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response directly addressing your question using the available information.  The search results returned only tables of contents from an unknown source, offering no relevant data.\n\nTo help you, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Review your usability testing data:**  Analyze the findings from your recent tests to identify specific areas where users encountered errors during login. This will provide the foundation for your redesign.\n\n2. **Research Figma design best practices:** Explore online resources, Figma's own documentation, and design articles focusing on user-friendly login forms.  Pay particular attention to best practices concerning input fields, error messaging, and visual design.\n\n3. **Consider common login form issues:**  Focus on common problems like unclear instructions, confusing error messages, weak password requirements, and poor accessibility.\n\n4. **Iterate and test:**  Once you've implemented changes, conduct further usability testing to assess the effectiveness of your redesign.\n\n\nI apologize that I cannot provide a more specific answer based on the currently available documents.

Unfortunately, the provided documents, titled \"Company Code of Principles\" (Source: `company_code_of_principles.md`), do not contain any information about SQL queries, databases, or sales data.

A typical approach would involve grouping sales data by month and then calculating the percentage change between consecutive months.
