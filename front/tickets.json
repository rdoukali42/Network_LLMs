    "response": "Subject: Re: Training Programshjmgh - Guidance on Contract Compliance and Regulatory Requirements for New Clients\n\nDear [Client Name],\n\nThank you for your inquiry regarding contract compliance and regulatory requirements for your new client.  I understand the importance of ensuring compliance, and I've reviewed our available documentation to address your request.\n\nUnfortunately, our current resources (specifically, `company_code_of_conduct.md`) do not contain the specific information you need regarding contract compliance and regulatory requirements for new clients.  The document focuses on general employee compliance with various laws and regulations, including employment law, anti-discrimination, environmental regulations, data protection, antitrust, and trade regulations [Source: company_code_of_conduct.md].  It outlines the importance of staying informed about relevant laws and reporting potential violations [Source: company_code_of_conduct.md].  However, it lacks details on client onboarding procedures, compliance checklists, or examples of compliant contracts.\n\nTherefore, I am unable to provide you with the specific guidance you requested directly from our current documentation.  To address this gap, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult Legal Counsel:**  Given the lack of internal resources addressing this specific issue, we strongly recommend seeking guidance from our legal department or external legal counsel specializing in contract compliance and relevant regulations. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific client and industry.\n\n2. **Research Relevant Regulations:**  Independently research the specific regulations applicable to your industry and client's location.  This may involve reviewing federal, state, and local laws, as well as industry-specific standards.\n\n3. **Develop Internal Procedures:**  In the absence of existing templates, consider developing internal procedures and checklists for onboarding new clients, ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations.  This could include steps for reviewing contracts, identifying potential risks, and establishing ongoing compliance monitoring.\n\n4. **Request Internal Training:**  If needed, request additional training on contract compliance and regulatory requirements for new clients.  This could involve internal workshops or external training programs.\n\nWe apologize that we couldn't directly answer your question using our current documentation. We are committed to improving our resources and will investigate adding more comprehensive information regarding client onboarding and contract compliance in the future.  Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaestro\nSupport Agent\n",
