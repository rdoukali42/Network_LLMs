Therefore, I cannot provide a response directly addressing your question using the available information.  The search results returned only tables of contents from an unknown source, offering no relevant data.\n\nTo help you, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Review your usability testing data:**  Analyze the findings from your recent tests to identify specific areas where users encountered errors during login. This will provide the foundation for your redesign.\n\n2. **Research Figma design best practices:** Explore online resources, Figma's own documentation, and design articles focusing on user-friendly login forms.  Pay particular attention to best practices concerning input fields, error messaging, and visual design.\n\n3. **Consider common login form issues:**  Focus on common problems like unclear instructions, confusing error messages, weak password requirements, and poor accessibility.\n\n4. **Iterate and test:**  Once you've implemented changes, conduct further usability testing to assess the effectiveness of your redesign.\n\n\nI apologize that I cannot provide a more specific answer based on the currently available documents.

I understand your concern about what happens if a violation occurs.\n\nBased on the currently available documentation, I unfortunately cannot provide a definitive answer to your question regarding the specific consequences of a code of conduct violation.  The documents I have access to detail the reporting procedures and protections against retaliation for reporting violations in good faith, but they do *not* specify the potential disciplinary actions or repercussions for violations themselves.\n\nThe available documentation does, however, outline several avenues for reporting violations:\n\n*   Your direct supervisor or manager\n*   The Human Resources department\n*   The ethics hotline\n*   An anonymous reporting system\n*   Senior management or the executive team\n\nIt is important to note that the company is committed to prompt, thorough, and confidential investigations into all reported violations.  Employees are expected to cooperate fully during these investigations.  Furthermore, the company provides protections against retaliation for reporting violations in good faith.\n\nBecause the information regarding the consequences of code of conduct violations is currently unavailable, I strongly recommend contacting your manager, Human Resources, or the ethics hotline to obtain a complete and accurate answer to your question.  They will be able to provide the most up-to-date and detailed information.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaestro, Support Agent\n",

    "response": "Subject: Re: Support Ticket: Question45 - Witnessing Workplace Harassment\n\nDear Employee,\n\nThank you for contacting us regarding your question about witnessing workplace harassment.  While our internal documents detail procedures for reporting workplace violations, they do not offer specific guidance on how to respond when witnessing harassment.  Therefore, I can offer the following general advice based on best practices and common workplace policies:\n\n**If you witness harassment:**\n\n1. **Ensure your safety:** Your personal safety is paramount.  Do not intervene if doing so would put you at risk.\n\n2. **Document the incident:** If possible and safe, discreetly note the date, time, location, individuals involved, and a brief description of what you witnessed.\n\n3. **Report the incident:** Report the incident using one of the following methods, choosing the method you feel most comfortable with:\n\n    * **Direct supervisor or manager:** Report the incident to your immediate supervisor or manager.\n    * **Human Resources department:** Contact the HR department to report the incident.\n    * **Ethics hotline:** Use the provided phone number to report anonymously or confidentially.\n    * **Anonymous reporting system:** Utilize the provided website or email address for anonymous reporting.\n    * **Senior management or executive team:** Report directly to senior management or the executive team.\n\n4. **Cooperate with the investigation:** If an investigation is launched, cooperate fully and provide any information you have.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Protection against retaliation:** The company prohibits retaliation against those who report violations in good faith.  Report any suspected retaliation immediately.\n* **Investigation process:** All reports will be investigated promptly and thoroughly, and confidentially.\n\n**Information Gaps:**\n\nPlease note that our current internal documentation lacks specific instructions on responding to witnessed harassment and does not define what constitutes a violation.  We are working to improve our resources to address these gaps.  If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact HR or utilize the anonymous reporting channels provided.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMaestro Support Agent\n",

    "response": "Subject: Re: Support Ticket: General - Workplace Harassment Policy and Reporting\n\nDear Employee,\n\nThank you for contacting us regarding workplace harassment.  While our internal documents detail the reporting procedures and protections available to you, they currently lack a comprehensive definition of what constitutes workplace harassment under company policy.  We apologize for this omission.  We are working to improve the clarity and accessibility of this information.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the following information on how to report harassment and what protections are in place:\n\n\n**Reporting Workplace Harassment:**\n\nYou can report harassment through several channels:\n\n*   Your direct supervisor or manager\n*   The Human Resources department\n*   The ethics hotline: [Phone Number]\n*   The anonymous reporting system: [Website/Email]\n*   Senior management or the executive team\n\n**Protection Against Retaliation:**\n\nThe company strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports harassment in good faith.  Retaliation includes, but is not limited to, adverse employment actions, further harassment, or other negative treatment.  If you believe you have experienced retaliation for reporting harassment, please report it immediately using any of the channels listed above.\n\n**Investigation Process:**\n\nAll reports of harassment will be investigated promptly, thoroughly, and confidentially.  Your cooperation during the investigation is appreciated.\n\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nBecause our documentation is currently incomplete regarding the definition of workplace harassment, we strongly recommend reaching out to Human Resources directly. They can provide more detailed information and answer any questions you may have.\n\n\nWe are committed to providing a safe and respectful workplace for all employees.  We appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Support Team\n",
