# Ticket Routing Test Queries and Expected Assignments

This document contains all test queries used to validate the HR Agent ticket routing system, along with expected assignments and additional test examples.

## Overview

The HR Agent system routes tickets to appropriate employees based on:
- Employee expertise and skills
- Department alignment
- Current availability and workload
- AI-powered matching algorithms

For document-based queries, the system uses the Data Guardian to search local company documents instead of assigning to employees.
